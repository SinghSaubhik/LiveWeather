There are many great Weather apps available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. This wil really come very close to your nedd.

Here's why:

- This is crafted very carefully using material design.
- The implementation has been kept as simple as possible so that any web dev can understand , modify and learn from it.
- **Vanilla React**: No thisrd party library is used to make robust and clean.


### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Saas](https://sass-lang.com)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
